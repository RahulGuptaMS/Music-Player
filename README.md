# Music-Player
This Android project is a feature-rich Music Player App developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. It not only plays music stored in the device but also supports audio recording using the deviceâ€™s microphone.  The user can play, pause, and switch to the next song, and also record custom audio which can be stored and later accessed.
